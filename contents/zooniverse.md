The Zooniverse is a collaborative environment in which volunteers can assist professional researchers in classifying or analyzing data. GREENBURST has two Zooniverse pages where anybody can sort through candidates to identify fast radio bursts. Find the two Zooniverse pages here:
1. [Identify FRBs from GREENBURST candidates](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/st0329/frb-finder)
2. [Help search through observations of elliptical galaxies to find FRBs](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/st0329/survey-of-elliptical-galaxies-frb-candidates)

GREENBURST also has a work-in-progress Zooniverse document containing a research writeup which will be appended whenever the document is finished.
