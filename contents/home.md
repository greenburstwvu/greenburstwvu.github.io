GREENBURST is a commensal radio survey searching for fast radio bursts and other radio transients using the Green Bank Telescope. Successful transient surveys require large amounts of on-sky time or large fields of view. Our custom backend, mounted on the GBT, takes data with the L-band receiver whenever the telescope is observing, regardless of the frontend in ruse. This means we can accumulate large amounts of data at little additional cost. Using a machine learning classifier, we’re able to search this data in real time.

Based at West Virginia University, GREENBURST has been operational for over half a decade. We’ve produced constraints on the fast radio burst all-sky rate and continue to search for new candidates. Our current work focuses on fast radio bursts, ultra-long period transients, and targeted searches of individual galaxies. Whenever the GBT is operational, we’re watching the sky.
